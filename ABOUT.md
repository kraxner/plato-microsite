*Efficient and Trustworthy Preservation Planning*

What Is Plato?
--------------
If you are responsible for ensuring authentic, long-term access to digital objects you will find that a variety of preservation actions are available. Choosing the most appropriate solution is a challenging and effort-intensive task as different user communities and individual organisations have specific needs when planning digital preservation activities. The solution should be based on objective criteria, and documented thoroughly to create confidence in your decision.

Plato supports you as a decision-maker by guiding you through the preservation planning workflow. To do this efficiently it integrates information from external sources including machine-readable information on the profile of your collection; registries of potential preservation action components and machine-readable information on your policy. The preservation action components can be run by Plato to automate tool evaluation, and connects to content repositories through open interfaces.

During this process Plato collects all the information in one place to enable you to make an informed decision. It then generates an evidence-based preservation plan which can be executed on suitable platforms.

In short, Plato is a decision-making support tool, which:

* guides you through the preservation planning workflow
* uses external information sources to increase efficiency
* utilises controlled experiments
* documents the process.
